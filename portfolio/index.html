I took input from managers, fellow designers and clients to design and prototyped the new patient portal.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>Increase useability across devices while adding new features to the then-current patient portal.</p><h3>Before redesign</h3><img class="portfolio-screenshot" src="/images/portfolio/patient-portal-before.jpg" /><h4>Pain points</h4><ul><li>Top header wasted on client's logo with no real actions other than signout (which isn't obvious).</li><li>Main navigation is placed, unexpectedly, on the right hand side, making them seem like secondary actions.</li><li>Unnecessary introduction below header. Moving the main nav to the header should do a better job of explaining what the user can do than extra text.</li><li>The lack of consistent alignment, dull textures and unnecessary use of wells makes the app aesthetically unpleasing.</li><li>Unclear what "actions" are. Use of bold text and icons appears to be random, so no meaning can be derived from them.</li></ul><h3>After redesign</h3><img class="portfolio-screenshot" src="/images/portfolio/patient-portal-desktop.jpg" /><h4>Changes</h4><ul><li>Moved main navigation to the very top, to meet user's expectations.</li><li>Changed "actions" to "to-do" to tell users that these are items that they need to attend to, whether it's going to an appointment, viewing test results or paying a bill.</li><li>Added shortcut buttons to items for registering for appointments and paying bills.</li><li>Added photo identification to differential between whose account the user is currently viewing. (Could be themself or a family member.)</li><li>Added "messages" section for patients to communicate with their doctors.</li><li>Added Electronic Health Record section.</li><li>Added help aside to supply the user with contextual guidance.</li><li>Added common actions toolbar.</li><li>Hopefully the new design makes it more clear what users are able to do in the app without needing to expicitely point it out to them.</li></ul><h4>Tablet and mobile</h4><img class="portfolio-screenshot--two-thirds" src="/images/portfolio/patient-portal-tablet.jpg" /><img class="portfolio-screenshot--one-third" src="/images/portfolio/patient-portal-mobile.jpg" /><ul><li>Hid less necessary information and actions.</li><li>Allowed the user to easily access hidden information by clicking the "i" tab on tablet or scrolling to the bottom of the page on mobile.</li></ul><p><small>&copy Vecna Technologies</small></p></div></section><section class="portfolio-section" id="immigration-planner"><div class="content"><h2>Immigration Planner</h2><p>I was hired by Immigration Planner as the web app's sole designer and engineer.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>Allow users to easily navigate the complex U.S. immigration system.</p><h3>The pieces</h3><ul><li>Eligibility checker - Is the user eligible for family-based immigration to the United States?</li><li>Checklist - What forms, documents, etc. does the user need to submit, and what other steps must be taken?</li><li>Filing address wizard - Where does the user need to mail their forms and documents?</li><li>Timeline - If the user begins now, when can they expect to receive their green card?</li></ul><p>Theses were originally thought of as a set of separate tools to help users complete the immigration process. I realized that these tools don't all work very well on their own, but when combined, because far more powerful. E.g. in order to give the user a customized checklist, we need to know their family relationship, their sponsor's legal status, and other variables, all of which we learn with the eligibitily checker. So why ask all those questions again?</p><p>What I designed is a workflow that begins with checking eligibility, the result of which shows the user their eligibility information along with a basic timeline, and then continues with the checklist. The filing address wizard is available when it becomes useful to the user.</p><img class="portfolio-screenshot" src="/images/portfolio/ip-questionnaire.jpg" /><ul><li>At the beginning of the survey, we ask the user for the name of the sponsor and applicant. This allows us to use their names in the following questions, help text and in the checklist. Without asking for names, the words "sponsor," "applicant" and "common parent" can quickly lead to confusion and incorrect answers, meaning we could end up giving bad advice.</li><li>We narrowed down the questionnaires to use as few questions as possible.</li><li>We split up questionnaires by topic so that we can give the user a new outcome as soon as we have new information to show them.</li><li>We provided optional instruction on most questions to help users supply the correct answer with confidence.</li></ul><img class="portfolio-screenshot" src="/images/portfolio/ip-checklist.jpg" /><ul><li>We split up the checklist into chronological segments. First the user must fill out the "initial application" and wait for a reply before moving on to the next section, and so on.</li><li>We reused the names from the questionnaire to personalize the checklist and avoid confusion.</li><li>Again, most checklist items are given contextual information to help users understand or complete each task.</li></ul><img class="portfolio-screenshot" src="/images/portfolio/ip-glossary.jpg" /><ul><li>We created an extensive glossary of terms that users are likely to come across in our application and throughout the immigration process.</li><li>When applicable, we provide quick links to definitions within questionnaire outcomes, in checklist help, etc. Here, you can see the glossary quick link being used within the glossary itself.</li></ul><p><small>&copy Mossettes Technologies</small></p></div></section><section class="portfolio-section" id="summer"><div class="content"><h2>Summer</h2><p>I created this app as a side project after being unsatisfied with the available apps on the Play Store. Many scorekeeping apps cost more money than I felt like spending on a glorified calculator. The free apps that are available often have far more features than I want, which means it takes longer to get the app set up, when all I want to do is start playing the game!</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>Allow users to keep score of many different games (Scrabble, gin rummy, 45s, Uno, whatever) with the easiest set-up and learning curve possible.</p><img class="portfolio-screenshot--half" src="/images/portfolio/summer-keyboard.png" /><img class="portfolio-screenshot--half" src="/images/portfolio/summer.png" /><p>When you launch the app, it will show your previous game, or a blank sheet if it's your first time in the app. From there, you can do one of 6 simple actions:</p><ul><li>Add a player by clicking the "+ person" icon.</li><li>Rename a player by clicking on a name and typing a new one in the keyboard.</li><li>Remove a player by clicking on a name then clicking the "remove player" button.</li><li>Select a score field by clicking on it or by using the arrow keys above the keyboard.</li><li>Change or set a score by selecting a field and typing the score in the keyboard.</li><li>Clear the game by clicking the eraser icon by the score totals.</li></ul><p>That's it. It doesn't save your games beyond the current one, so you don't have to give the name a game. You're only allowed 3 characters per game (old arcade style), so more player columns can fit the screen and start up is quicker. There's nothing beyond what's absolutely necessary.</p></div></section><section class="portfolio-section" id="testimonials"><div class="content"><h2>Testimonials</h2><blockquote>Justin Silva has proven to me over and over his outstanding web publishing skills.
